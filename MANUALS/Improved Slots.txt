you have now 20 Slots.

For using 11-20 Slots, press Alt+number. (you can change that keys in Options/controls)

we have made 2 different of it.
Normally we use an arrangement which functions in all resolutions well. (4x5)

if you only use resolutions 1024x... or higher, you can use a better looking version of it. (2X10)
for using the better looking versin, edit this file
BLOCKLAND\rtb\client\init.cs

search for          exec("./ui/PlayGui2.gui");
change it into     exec("./ui/PlayGui.gui");
