This adds some colors to your chat hud, so if you type /(color),
it'll make your text color that color, except for the name.
Type /help for a complete listing.


if you want to chat all the time with one color.
Open BAC's MAIN MENU (M) and chouse your Chatcolor.


if you use this permanent Chatcolor, the color commands /(color) dont work.
(only with permanent Chatcolor yellow (OFF), you can use color commands)
